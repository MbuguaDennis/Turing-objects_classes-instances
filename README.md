# Objects,Classes, and Instances
## Learning Goals
- Describe the difference between a class and an instance of a that class
- Define a class
 A class in Ruby defines the structure and behavior of objects. It is like a template, but it doesn't represent any real-world object until it's instantiated (created) as an object.
- Store state in instance variables defined in initialize
- Provide access to state using attr_readers and attr_accessors 
- Use methods to provide behaviors to instances of a class
- Create a new instance of a class and call methods on that instance
